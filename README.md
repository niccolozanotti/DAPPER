## Stommel model of Atlantic Ocean Circulation : A case study

We analyze the behavior of Stommel two-box model of Ocean Circulation (water flux driven by Temperature and Salinity difference) when the system is subject to external perturbations (forcings), e.g. a cold water flux due to Greenland ice sheet melt or a polar warming rate.

### DA
We compare the results obtained using Ensemble Data Assimilation (ETKF; see pag. 9 of the [report](report.pdf)) and without it.

### Code

The code to generate the figs sits at [`/dapper/mods/Stommel`](/dapper/mods/Stommel).

### Report
